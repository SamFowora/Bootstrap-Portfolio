# my-portfolio

## Description

This webpage is serving as my portfolio - similar to the previous one except that this one is powered by Bootstrap. By using Bootstrap, things were quite easy to understand, however I do not feel like I have been able to use the extents of Bootstrap given the knowledge I have. At the same time, maybe I am being a little harsh on  myself so there can be a bit of leeway given on that part.
My motivation for this project was the same as the last portfolio's motivation - being able to make a page which would serve as a spot to find all my work - be it coding, architecture, or even other things in the future (which may be quite fun as some of my friends are asking me to pursue making music content aha).
The challenge this week was finding out how to use the new effects correctly, as well as looking at every line as closely as possible to make sure the classes were correct. I think another challenge which I never really wrapped my head around was disabling the hover effect for the webpage title. I'll definitely research into that a little more.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website is a simple one, with all the parts clearly labelled and a nice box effect to make things easily legible. Due to the fact that this is a fundamentally unfinished product, there is still placeholder images which will be replaced with actual images as time goes by, however links to projects are available and working. The README will be updated to reflect that when it happens.
